# ATtiny85-Developmnet-Board

### Introduction:
ATTiny85 is an 8-bit AVR RISC microcontroller available in packages like PDIP, SOIC, QNC, MLF etc. It has 8KB of flash memory, 512B of SRAM and 512B of EEPROM. It has 8 pins, 6 I/O pins among which there are 3 Analog Pins and 2 PWM pins. This microcontroller also has MISO & MOSI pins and SDA & SCL pins. This microcontroller is compatible with Arduino IDE
For this board I have used the SOIC package. The features of this board are:
*	It is compatible with breadboard.
*	It has both 5V and 3.3V output pins
*	It can be powered using both USB and a PWR pin
*	It has an on board reset button for manual reset.
